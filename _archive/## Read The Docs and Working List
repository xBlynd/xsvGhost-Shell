## Read The Docs
	- Right now if someone came into the project.  They would be met with a little of a confusing high level readme.  Without knowing the passion of the build and what it is intended to be.  Someone should be able to go into a "Read the Docs" kinda thing(i know python has some).  And get a detailed summary, read mes and how too's on everything.  This is not a task we can complete in one sitting.  But we need to make this a general practice.  Even when we create commands to update a section of "Read the Docs" so people know why the command exists and how it works incase there is other commands of anything that may tie into it, or it breaks with future changes.

## Cross Platform
	- Confirm everything is set up running on different devices and operating systems.
	- Probably should add a "status" check of some sorts for the "Status Board / Command"
	- Confirm this functions in a VM.

## Login and Startup - THIS NEEDS TO BE seperated.  I will want to adjust login screen in future without breaking anything.

- Need a Startup that ties into the Security Check.  After login or signin completed, so a System Info pull and a "status" and sync check or something.

**First run:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║    FIRST TIME SETUP - CREATE USER  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝

Create username: ian
Create password (min 8 chars): ••••••••••
Confirm password: ••••••••••

[✓] User 'ian' created.
[✓] Ready to use vault.
```

```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║      xsv VAULT - SECURE LOGIN      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝

Username: ian
Password: ••••••••••

[✓] Authentication successful.
[→] Vault unlocked.
```



## Security
	- Login modifications. 
	- Security Upgrade in Core / Engine
	- Hiding the Code?  When we plug this into a computer, the host machine "could" see all the files and raw code or my private info.  Is there a way to "hide" this entire project?

## Ghost Terminal
	- Make it beautiful and clean.


## Vault: Finish or make a Better encryption.... 
	- Not even sure we have anything in place yet.

## Sync
	- Cloud sync?
	- Github syncs?
	- Need to seperate this to it doesn't break other things but still syncs everything.
	- We need to make sure we have EVERYTHING covered in this sync.  Essientially a "global" list?  



## Status


## Help Menu
	- Want to make a better looking Help Menu.



## Version Control
	- We need better version control and everything.  If the core updates and breaks a command we need to reference versions etc.  Set the standard early.


## Host - More Host interaction options.
- Network Monitoring
	- Monitoring available in Ghost Terminal or create a new terminal session on Host Machine detached from the "Ghost Shell"
	-Have an option to "create" a logging system that we can install on Host PC to monitor and create logs so we can review data.  Example.  There is a persistant issue and we cannot see it right away.  So we need to keep logs to check whats going on throughout the day and night. "This can be used on a variety of "Host" things we build...  
- Latency checks
- Check files
- Scan OS files / computer


## Settings - Command Center Settings
	- We need to remember the "Settings Page".  Anything that can have a setting that should change or can change.  Should be integrated into the settings somehow.  This will be helpful with a future dashboard or a webapp or whatever.


## Note System

**Key Changes:**
- No per-line timestamps
- Each "note" can have multiple **entries**
- First entry gets timestamp when created
- Subsequent entries get timestamp when added

**Flow:**

```
>>> note

┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  xsv NOTE EDITOR                     │
│  (Type your note. SAVE to finish)    │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
