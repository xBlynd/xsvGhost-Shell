# 👻 Ghost Shell (Phoenix Branch)

This branch is a clean-room rebuild of Ghost Shell using the 11-engine architecture from the Ghost System Atlas.

- One core Kernel orchestrating 11 Engines
- Commands are MANIFEST-driven and auto-discovered
- Legacy files from previous experiments are intentionally removed

See `docs/` for the living Atlas and Architecture.
