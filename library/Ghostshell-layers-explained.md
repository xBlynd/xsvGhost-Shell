## Ok while we are here idk how i feel about xsvCommand Center.  Its kinda plain and boring.  So lets think of that while we are doing this.  Maybe thats our xsvStudio "xsvGhost Shell" or just "Ghost Shell"?

## Ghost Shell  "idk what they call this."

Now the Core "Need a name for Core" "Ghostcore"?  it this is the path we are going.
